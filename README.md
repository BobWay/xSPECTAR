# xSPECTAR

Welcome to the xSPECTARverse. The metaverse built on the XRP Ledger.

The xSPECTARverse is not being developed on GitHub. We are using https://www.plasticscm.com a source code management system designed by Unity for game developers.

As we are ready to release our open source 3D Browser and 3D Server components, the source code will be moved to GitHub for public access.

For the moment, an inital running version of xSPECTAR's Community Hall can be previewed and downloaded here:

This represents the first building designed for the xSPECTARverse and serves as an Art Gallery for 60 different NFT projects.
